I created the Panel8x8 library back in 2009.
I thought I had lost source code to the utilites I created in VB,
But I found them again today.
For safetey I'm posting them to Github.

The main project is actually hosted at http://Panel8x8.GoogleCode.Com
This is just an archive of the vb.net code,
The main arduino library is at Googlecode.

I decided to include the Panel8x8Support_V0100.msi file for simpler installs.
I also included all the library source under Arduino.
Last Version was Panel8x8_V0109.zip and is expanded under the Arduino\Panel8x8 folder
